# first-assignment
A simple website to demonstrate and solidify my skills so far in my current bootcamp lesson.
Reflection
- Initially had a problem of getting the image which was situated in folder to show up on deployed website and after extensive research, found out that websites like ibb could host images which after I'd done this, my image showed up on my deployed website.
- Used resources like dev community (discovered ibb here), W3Schools and my past projects for recall and a bit of new knowledge.
