# first-assignment

A simple website to demonstrate and solidify my skills so far in my current bootcamp lesson.
Reflection
-I hit a roadblock with getting my images from a folder I'd created to show up after deployment but after a deep search, I found that I could host images on sites like ibb which after I'd done it, my images showed up
-I also had a git problem later on and my directory wouldn't push but I rebased after a long time trying to figure it out and it worked.
-I used resources like DEV community (I found out about image hosting here), youtube, W3Schools and my previous project tryouts for recall and a bit of help.

- I did not particularly find anything too difficult except adding background music which I eventually left out.
